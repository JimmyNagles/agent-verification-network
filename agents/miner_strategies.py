"""
Miner Strategies — Different analysis approaches for competing miners.

Each strategy wraps the base analyze_code() function but tweaks which
passes run, how severity is weighted, and what extra checks are performed.
This makes miners produce genuinely different results for the same code,
so the leaderboard reflects real competition.

Strategies:
    - ast-heavy:         Full AST + patterns, skip LLM. Higher confidence on structural bugs.
    - security-focused:  All patterns with boosted severity for security. Extra security regexes.
    - intent-focused:    Lighter AST but enhanced intent heuristics. Uses LLM if available.
    - default:           Runs everything as-is (backward compatible).
